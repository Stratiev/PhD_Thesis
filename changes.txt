- Fixed Introduction headers - ✓
- Remove needless pages (Put the specific page numbers that were removed) -
- Put descriptive captions on all the figures so that they appear nicely in the list of figures. 
    - 1.1 Improved the Large gauge transformation caption. ✓
    - 1.2 Improved flux attachment caption. ✓ hbar consistency?
- Use the same conventions everywhere. For example:
    - Anti-hermitean gauge fields
    - N
    - Capitalize QHE, CS, PV, FB
- Improve the transition before the large gauge transformation example.
- Expanded the introduction so that it places the thesis in context.
