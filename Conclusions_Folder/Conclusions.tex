\begin{itemize}
    \item Vortex creation driven by chemical potential only. No SB potential.
    \item Symmetry broken phase in the $SU(2)$ theory that persists in the conformal phase of quartic coupling going to zero.
    \item Non-commutative gauge theory arising from a ground state that seems to only appear in the finite chemical potential limit.
    \item Non-abelian Topological Chern-Simons vortices that also seem to only exist in the finite chemical potential regime.
    \item The Non-commutative description seems to be a gateway into understanding and solving the large $N$ $SU(N)$ theory exactly. In addition, this non-commutativity gives us a hint into how the fermionic description might arise in this sort of system.
\end{itemize}
