    We study several matter Chern-Simons models at finite chemical potential. In the SU(N) theory we discover a color-flavour locking Bose condensed ground state with vacuum expectation values for both the scalars and the gauge fields. We identify this ground state with the non-commutative Chern-Simons description of the quantum hall effect. We compute the quadratic spectrum and discover roton excitations. We find a self-consistent circularly symmetric ansatz for topological non-abelian vortices. We examine vortices in Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to a relativistic scalar field with a chemical potential for particle number or U(1) charge. The Gauss constraint requires chemical potential for the local symmetry to be accompanied by a constant background charge density/magnetic field. Focusing attention on power law scalar potentials $âˆ¼ |\Phi|^{2s}, \, s\in \mathbb{Z}$ which do not support vortex configurations in vacuum but do so at finite chemical potential, we numerically study classical vortex solutions for large winding number $|n|\gg  1$.
