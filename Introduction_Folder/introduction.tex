\chapter{Introduction}

This will be the introduction chapter. I will talk about:



\begin{itemize}
    \item The reunion of QFT and CMT that has been sparked in recent years by studies such as dualities
    \item Importance of topological field theory in practice. Quantum Computing and \textit{etc}. 
    \item Most importantly, highlight the importance of studying dualities as a tool to understand strongly coupled field theories. Deforming well known dualities and attempting to match the two sides takes us closer to having dual descriptions of theories that are of physical interest.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
